      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Competition Rules</h1>

      <p className="mb-4">
        The Vibraxx Arena runs 24/7, featuring new questions every 3 minutes.
        Each round consists of one skill-based question, requiring accuracy and speed.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">1. Fair Play</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        All players compete on equal terms. Automated scripts, multiple accounts, or fraudulent behavior
        result in immediate suspension. Integrity and skill are the only valid factors.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">2. Scoring</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Points are awarded based on correctness and response time. Faster correct answers earn higher rank.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">3. Prizes</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Weekly prizes (e.g. Â£100â€“Â£1000) are awarded to top performers only.
        Prizes are treated as skill-based performance rewards, not gambling winnings.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">4. Transparency</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        All question sets, round timing, and results are logged securely and may be verified
        to confirm fairness and lack of randomization.
