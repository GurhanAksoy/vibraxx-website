      <p className="mb-4">
        VIBRAXX is operated by <strong>Sermin Limited</strong> (â€œweâ€, â€œusâ€, â€œourâ€), a UK-registered company
        trading as â€œVIBRAXXâ€. Our platform hosts a continuous, skill-based trivia competition.
        These Terms govern your access to and use of the Vibraxx Arena.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">1. Nature of Service</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Vibraxx is a <strong>skill-based competition</strong>. No element of chance or luck determines
        the outcome of any round or prize. All results are based on participant skill, accuracy,
        and response time.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">2. Access & Payment</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Access to the Arena requires a small daily membership fee (Â£1/day). This fee grants you
        participation rights for 24 hours. It is not a bet, wager, or stake, and carries no financial risk.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">3. Rewards & Fair Play</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Weekly prizes are distributed to top-performing participants based solely on skill.
        In case of identical scores, the faster total response time determines the winner.
        All results are recorded transparently and may be audited.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">4. Compliance</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Vibraxx operates under Section 6 of the UK Gambling Act 2005 as a skill-based competition.
        It does not constitute gambling, gaming, or betting activity.
